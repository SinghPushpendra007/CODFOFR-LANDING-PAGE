Landing Page
CodSoft Internship Task-2

COMPANY: CODSOFT
NAME: PUSHPENDRA SINGH
INTERN ID: CS25RY11363
DOMAIN: WEB DEVELOPMENT
DURATION: 4 WEEKS

Designing a landing page using HTML and CSS for my internship project at CodSoft is a valuable opportunity to highlight my front-end development skills. Below is an overview of the process, the technologies I will employ, and the potential impact of this project.

Purpose of a Landing Page
A landing page serves as the first point of interaction for students visiting a website. Its primary objective is to capture their attention, deliver clear and engaging information about courses and services, and motivate them to take specific actions, such as signing up, enrolling, or exploring further.

In this project, the landing page will reflect CodSoft’s brand identity and mission. It should effectively communicate the company’s values, available courses, and unique offerings while ensuring a visually appealing design that captivates users.
